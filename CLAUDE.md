# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`mage-os/module-ai-base` — a small Magento 2 module (`MageOS_AiBase`) that exposes an admin configuration UI for registering multiple AI backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Deepseek, HuggingFace, LM Studio, Ollama, OpenRouter, OpenAI-Compatible), a provider-agnostic client (`AiClientInterface`) other modules use to actually make calls, and a consumer API for reading the stored configuration directly. Every call made through the bundled client is also recorded — token counts and metadata only, never prompt or response content — into two tables and surfaced on a **Reports > AI Token Usage** dashboard, an admin grid, and a `bin/magento mageos:ai:usage` CLI report; see `docs/USAGE-TRACKING.md`. It does **not** estimate cost, and it cannot record a call made through the `PlatformAwareInterface::getPlatform()` escape hatch, which bypasses the client entirely.

The module is installed into a host Magento 2 app; this repo contains no runnable Magento instance and no build step.

## Commands

In this repo:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit        # needs a Magento install for the tests that mock generated factories
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Platform    # the chat client layer; needs symfony/ai-platform, run in CI with --fail-on-skipped
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse                 # level 10 over src/, configured in phpstan.neon
vendor/bin/phpcs                           # Magento2 ruleset over src/, configured in phpcs.xml.dist
```

The `Unit` suite is only fully green inside a Magento install: `AiServiceSelectorTest` and
`ClientFactoryTest` mock Magento's auto-generated `*Factory` classes, which the ObjectManager code
generator fabricates only there. CI covers that with a separate job (see
`.github/workflows/check-extension.yaml`), which is why `phpunit.xml.dist` splits out `Platform`.

The `Integration` suite cannot run from this repo at all — it needs a running Magento install with
the integration test framework and a database. From inside one that has this module installed:

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist ../../../vendor/mage-os/module-ai-base/Test/Integration
```

CI runs exactly that, in the reusable workflow's `integration_test` job, which appends this
directory to Magento's own `dev/tests/integration/phpunit.xml.dist` as a testsuite.
`.github/check-extension.json` keeps that job switched on explicitly.

The `End-2-End` suite drives the real admin form in a browser with Playwright:

```bash
cd tests/End-2-End
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
E2E_DISPOSABLE_ENVIRONMENT=1 BASE_URL="https://your-store.test/" \
  ADMIN_USER=... ADMIN_PASSWORD=... npx playwright test
```

Two specs seed usage rows, which needs a way to reach Magento: `E2E_MAGENTO_EXEC` is the command
that gets to it (`docker exec store` in CI) and `E2E_MAGENTO_ROOT` the install's path in there.
Unset, both fall back to running PHP against the local filesystem, which is what a DDEV run wants.

**It deletes every configured AI service on the target install before each spec**, and stored
credentials cannot be read back once gone, which is what `E2E_DISPOSABLE_ENVIRONMENT=1` is there to
make you say out loud. Never point it at an install whose configuration matters. CI runs it in a
throwaway container, once in developer mode and once in production, because the form offers
different providers in each; specs that only apply to one are tagged `@developer-mode` or
`@production-mode`. Run it through DDEV (`ddev exec ...`), never on the host.

Anything reading `system.xml` — the backend model on a field, the config structure — needs
`#[\Magento\TestFramework\Fixture\AppArea('adminhtml')]` on the test class. `system.xml` is only
read into the config structure for that area; elsewhere the field silently has no backend model,
and Magento falls back to the plain config `Value`.

Host-side (run inside a Magento 2 install that has this module via `composer require mage-os/module-ai-base`):

```bash
php bin/magento module:enable MageOS_AiBase
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

Admin UI lives at **Stores → Configuration → Mage-OS → AI Configuration**; usage tracking lives at
**Reports → AI Token Usage**.

## Architecture

There are two intentionally separate interfaces — do not conflate them:

- **`Api\Data\AiServiceConfigurationInterface`** (`getCode`, `getName`, `getConfigurationFields`, `getSupportedModels`) — describes an *available* backend: its machine code, display name, admin form fields and curated model list. Implementations extend `AiServices\AbstractAiService` and live in `src/AiServices/*.php`. These are registered once in `etc/di.xml`, on the `services` array argument of `Model\ServiceRegistry`; the admin form block, the `ConfiguredService` option source, `Model\Config\SensitiveDataProcessor` and the `RefreshModels` controller all read that registry.
- **`Api\Data\AiServiceInterface`** (`getId`, `getCode`, `getConfiguration`) — represents a *configured instance* (stored row id + code + stored credentials/model/etc. array). Produced at runtime by `Model\AiServiceSelector` through `AiServiceInterfaceFactory`. `getId()` is the JSON object key of the row, which the admin form preserves across saves; it is the identity another module stores when an administrator picks a service.

`AiServiceSelectorInterface` is the public consumer API. It resolves at store scope in whatever scope is ambient, and takes no scope argument, so adminhtml/cron/CLI always read the default scope. The one exception is internal: the admin actions that must act on the scope being edited (Test Connection, Refresh Models, the `ConfiguredService` option source) wrap their lookup in `Model\ServiceScope::run()`, which makes `Model\AiServiceSelector` read that website or store scope instead (`Model\Config\ConfigScopeResolver` reads it off the config page's `website`/`store` parameters):

```php
AiServiceSelectorInterface::getAll(): AiServiceInterface[]
AiServiceSelectorInterface::getByCode(string $code): AiServiceInterface[]
AiServiceSelectorInterface::getById(string $id): ?AiServiceInterface
```

Consumer modules that want the administrator to choose a service point a `select` field in their own `system.xml` at `Model\Config\Source\ConfiguredService` (or `ConfiguredServiceWithAutomatic`, which prepends an empty-valued "Automatic" option) and resolve the stored row id through `getById()` or `AiClientFactoryInterface::createById()`.

Multiple entries per code are possible because admins can add the same backend multiple times in the UI, which is why `getByCode` returns an array.

`Api\ServiceImporterInterface` (impl. `Model\Config\ServiceImporter`) is the one write API: another module's data patch calls `import()` / `importFromConfig()` to move its own saved credentials into a default-scope row and gets the row id back. It encrypts through `SensitiveDataProcessor` and writes through `StoredServicesStorageInterface`, never through the config backend model, so keep those the single definition of a stored row; see "Import path" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Stored data flow:

1. Admin form is an `AbstractFieldArray` rendered via `view/adminhtml/templates/system/config/form/field/services.phtml`.
2. Each `AiServiceConfigurationInterface::getConfigurationFields()` returns `Api\Data\FieldDescriptorInterface` objects (name, label, type, options, default, encrypted). `Block\Adminhtml\Configuration\Services::getServicesSchemaJson()` turns them into a JSON schema keyed by service code, and the JavaScript in services.phtml builds the per-row inputs from it when the admin clicks one of the "Add Service" buttons. Providers never emit HTML.
3. `Model\Config\Backend\EncryptedServices` (an `ArraySerialized` subclass) encrypts the flagged fields and stores the posted rows as JSON in `core_config_data` at path **`mageos_ai/services/configuration`**.
4. `AiServiceSelector::getParsedConfig()` reads that path, json_decodes it, decrypts the flagged fields and wraps each row with `AiServiceInterfaceFactory`. Each row's structure is `{ _rowId: { <service_code>: { ...fields } } }`, which is why the selector does `array_key_first($row)` to extract the code.

**Usage tracking** adds two real database tables (not `core_config_data`), declared in `etc/db_schema.xml`:

- `mageos_ai_usage_log`: one row per call the client actually sent, not only the ones that succeeded (service id/code, model, consumer, store id, six independently-nullable token counts: prompt, completion, total, cache read, cache write, reasoning, plus whether it streamed, whether it failed, `created_at`). `Model\Client\RecordingAiClient` / `RecordingPlatformAwareAiClient` write to it; `ClientFactory` decides whether to wrap a built client with either, based on `Model\Usage\UsageConfig::isEnabled()` and whether the client is `PlatformAwareInterface`. A call `Exceptions\AiRequestNotSentException` rejected before it reached the provider gets no row: nothing was billed for it.
- `mageos_ai_usage_daily` — one row per (`usage_date`, service id, model, consumer, store id) grouping key per day, written by `Cron\RollUpUsage` / `Model\Usage\UsageMaintenance` before it prunes the raw table. Both tables' pruning windows are the `retention_days` / `daily_retention_days` fields under `mageos_ai/usage/*`.

`Api\UsageStatsInterface` (impl. `Model\Usage\UsageStats`) is the one read contract behind the **Reports → AI Token Usage** dashboard, its grid, and `bin/magento mageos:ai:usage`; it merges both tables per `Api\Data\Period`, never double-counting a day present in both. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full recording/roll-up data flows and the decision record on what is deliberately out of scope (no content, no cost estimate, no tracking past `getPlatform()`).

## Adding a new AI backend

1. Create `src/AiServices/<Name>.php` extending `AiServices\AbstractAiService` (never implement `AiServiceConfigurationInterface` directly; the base class is what keeps providers working when that interface gains a method). Override `getSupportedModels()` and, when the defaults (API key + model) don't fit, `getConfigurationFields()` using the protected field builders.
   **Every field that holds a credential must set `'encrypted' => true` on its descriptor** (`AbstractAiService::apiKeyField()` does). That flag is what encrypts the value at rest and masks it in the form. `Model\Config\SensitiveDataProcessor` also has a name-based fallback for rows whose provider is no longer registered, but it only recognises common credential names (`api_key`, `client_secret`, `access_token`, `password`, ...) and exists as defense in depth, not as the mechanism.
2. Register it in `etc/di.xml` under the `services` argument of `Model\ServiceRegistry`. The item name should match the class's `getCode()`, which is what the registry keys by.
3. To make it usable through the bundled client, add a `Model\Client\BridgeRegistry` entry with its `factory`, `package` and request-option `dialect` (see `Model\Client\OptionNormalizer` for the dialects). If the bridge factory's `createPlatform()` doesn't take the API key first, override `getPlatformArguments()` (`Api\PlatformArgumentsProviderInterface`); `ClientFactory` has no per-provider code.
4. For a live model list, implement `Api\ModelListProviderInterface` and inject `Api\JsonFetcherInterface`.
5. No other wiring is required — the admin UI and selector pick it up automatically.

## Conventions observed in this codebase

- PHP 8 constructor property promotion + `readonly` is the norm; follow it for new classes.
- `declare(strict_types=1)` in every file under `src/`; keep it that way.
- Docblocks on every class, method and constant, including private ones, and they explain *why* rather than restating the signature. This is heavier than most Magento modules; match it.
- `composer.json` requires `php: ^8.2` and `magento/framework: ^103.0.7 || ^104.0` (Magento 2.4.7+, the oldest line whose Symfony components resolve next to symfony/ai-platform). symfony/ai-platform and the OpenAI and Anthropic bridges are hard requirements pinned to `^0.14`; every other bridge stays a `suggest` — see the decision record in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- ACL resources (both in `etc/acl.xml`): `MageOS_AiBase::configuration` sits under `Magento_Backend::stores_settings` > `Magento_Config::config` with the other configuration sections, and `MageOS_AiBase::usage` under `Magento_Reports::report` > `MageOS_AiBase::reports`, beside its menu item. Never nest the configuration resource under something a non-admin role is routinely given (it guards credentials and outbound requests), and never change either id: role grants are stored by id.

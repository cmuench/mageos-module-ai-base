## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-08

The first stable release. Everything under `Api\` and `Exceptions\` is marked `@api`, with a note
on each type saying whether it is safe to implement or only to call; `docs/CONSUMING.md` has the
details under "What's stable".

### Added
- **Configuration.** An admin form at **Stores > Configuration > Mage-OS > AI Configuration** for
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, LM Studio, Ollama,
  OpenRouter and OpenAI-Compatible (LiteLLM and other self-hosted gateways). The same provider can
  be added more than once; each row has an optional name, an enable toggle, Test Connection and
  Refresh Models (a live model list for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama and LM
  Studio). Rows can be set per website and store view. Production mode only offers providers whose
  Symfony AI bridge is installed; developer mode lists the rest with the `composer require` to run.
- **Reading configuration.** `AiServiceSelectorInterface` (`getAll()`, `getByCode()`, `getById()`)
  and the `ConfiguredService` / `ConfiguredServiceWithAutomatic` option sources, so another module
  can let an administrator pick a configured row and store its id.
- **Client.** `AiClientFactoryInterface::create()` / `createById()` build an `AiClientInterface`
  backed by symfony/ai-platform, with `complete()`, multi-turn `chat()` and `streamChat()`. Tool
  calls are surfaced, never executed; reasoning is carried between tool-loop turns; a finished
  stream returns the assembled turn. `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `tool_choice`
  and `reasoning_effort` are translated into each provider's own request format. Failures are
  typed (`AiAuthenticationException`, `AiRateLimitedException`, `AiTransientException`,
  `AiInvalidRequestException`, `AiContentFilteredException`, `AiToolCallException`), all
  extending `AiServiceException`, plus `AiRequestNotSentException` for a call refused before it
  reached the provider. Every one is a `LocalizedException`.
  `ChatRequestBuilderInterface` builds requests without touching `Model\` classes, and
  `PlatformAwareInterface` hands over the underlying Symfony AI platform for anything else.
- **Usage tracking.** Every call through the client is recorded (token counts and metadata, never
  content) per service row, model, consumer and store, rolled up daily by cron and pruned after a
  configurable retention. Shown at **Reports > AI Token Usage** as a dashboard and a grid, and by
  `bin/magento mageos:ai:usage`; read programmatically through `UsageStatsInterface`. Consumers
  name themselves with the `$consumer` argument or `AiClientInterface::OPTION_CONSUMER`.
- **Extensibility.** Providers extend `AiServices\AbstractAiService` and register in one `di.xml`
  list (`Model\ServiceRegistry`). Bridges and their request-option dialects are `di.xml` data on
  `Model\Client\BridgeRegistry` and `Model\Client\OptionNormalizer`. Optional capabilities:
  `ModelListProviderInterface` (live model lists, through `JsonFetcherInterface`) and
  `PlatformArgumentsProviderInterface` (bridge factories that take more than an API key).

### Changed
Since v0.0.1:
- symfony/ai-platform and the OpenAI and Anthropic bridges are required at `^0.14`; the other
  bridges remain a `suggest` at the same line.
- Client exceptions live in `MageOS\AiBase\Exceptions`, including `AiRequestNotSentException`
  (was `Model\Client`).
- Providers extend `AbstractAiService`, which replaces `FieldFactoryTrait` and gives every method
  added to `AiServiceConfigurationInterface` later a default. Bridge factory arguments come from
  the provider instead of a switch in `ClientFactory`.
- `PlatformAwareInterface::getPlatform()` returns `PlatformInterface`. `StreamChunk`, `ToolCall`
  and `TokenUsage` implement `JsonSerializable` instead of `getData()`. The usage repositories'
  reporting methods are internal; the table layout is not public API.
- `StreamChunkType` gained `ThinkingStart` and `ToolCallStart`; a `match` without a default arm
  needs updating. A response cut off at the token limit returns with `FinishReason::Length`
  instead of throwing.
- Refreshed model lists are stored per row, so two rows of one provider on different hosts keep
  their own list. Test Connection, Refresh Models and the option sources act on the scope being
  edited.
- Curated fallback model lists updated: GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4 (mini, nano) and GPT-4.1 for OpenAI and
  Azure, Gemini's `-latest` aliases, and version-neutral labels for DeepSeek's two aliases.
- The configuration ACL resource moved from Stores > Attributes to Stores > Configuration. Its id
  is unchanged, so existing role grants keep working.

### Removed
- The `xai` and `grok` providers. Symfony AI has no xAI bridge, so neither could ever be called.
  A stored `xai` row is dropped the next time AI Configuration is saved.

### Fixed
- Gemini calls that set `tool_choice` were rejected with a 400; tool schemas with no properties
  are sent as a JSON object.
- A per-call model override on Azure, which always runs its configured deployment, now throws
  `AiRequestNotSentException` instead of being ignored while usage recorded the wrong model. A
  model the platform cannot route also throws it, without writing a failed usage row.
- Network failures map to `AiTransientException`; `ChatRequestBuilder::withAssistantTurn()` keeps
  the reasoning on the replayed turn.
- Usage from cron and CLI is recorded against store 0 (shown as "Admin, cron and CLI"), days are
  bucketed in the default-scope timezone, the daily roll-up adds to an existing day under a lock
  instead of overwriting it, and two rows of one provider get their own trend line.
- The AI Configuration form works at website and store scope, refuses an empty save from a form
  whose script did not finish rendering, and shows the deployment-lock warning only when the
  value is actually locked.

### Security
- Credentials are encrypted at rest, masked as `******` in the form, dumped to `env.php` rather
  than the commonly committed `config.php`, and re-encrypted when the encryption key is rotated.
- A stored key is dropped when a row's endpoint changes in the same save, for any field a provider
  flags as an endpoint, so a key cannot be redirected to another host. Refresh Models takes the
  provider from the stored row, not from the request.
- Test Connection and Refresh Models log provider and HTTP client errors instead of echoing them
  into the page, where a URL could carry a token ([#52](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-ai-base/issues/52)).
- The credential-name fallback for rows of an uninstalled provider recognises far more names
  ([#53](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-ai-base/issues/53)).
- Everything the form embeds in its script is JSON-encoded with `JSON_HEX_TAG` and friends, and
  the script is rendered through `SecureHtmlRenderer` for CSP.

### Upgrading from 0.0.1
- `composer update mage-os/module-ai-base --with-dependencies`, and bump any suggested bridges you
  installed to `^0.14`.
- `bin/magento setup:upgrade` and `bin/magento setup:di:compile`. The usage tables are unchanged.
- Model lists refreshed under 0.0.1 are still read as a fallback; click Refresh Models on each row
  to move it to its own list.
- Custom code: catch the client exceptions from `MageOS\AiBase\Exceptions\` instead of
  `Model\Client\`, extend `AbstractAiService` instead of using `FieldFactoryTrait`, and replace
  `getData()` on stream chunks with `json_encode($chunk)`.
